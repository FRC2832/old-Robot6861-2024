For our inputs, we require input buffering.  This is because some of our devices (especially CAN based) make a request to the hardware each time the get function is called.  Instead, for most of our hardware interfaces, there is an updateInputs() call to query all the devices, then we return to the system the buffered output calls.  Usually, the update call is from a subsystem periodic(), which happens before the command scheduler runs.
